      <p>RE: is an information centre about all kinds of homebrew and mods for tech of the past. That DS sitting in your drawer, or your childhood PlayStation can be turned into devices with impressive capabilities via some tinkering. Nowadays, tech is all about excitement and pushing limits, but I'm sure you have fond memories of devices with less power than the average smartphone. Sometimes slowing down, and looking back, is the best way forward.

        <p>This site contains many resources and a LOT of links to other sites, as it is more of a springboard to highlight communities that I recommend you check out. <br><br>  There are many websites that contain information, repos and even homebrew 'stores' featuring software all by other passionate people. No matter the success of a device, your nostalgia for its games or even just a passing interest, I think being more curious about the tech of our always developing ecosystem is important. <br><br> I believe that behind every console is a community that will continue to love it for years to come. Be it people still releasing custom games for old SEGA consoles or kickstarters just for an analogue replacement of the Nintendo 64. <br><br> Websites are all made by people with passion, and I hope my own can be of use to you.</p>

        <h1 class="textheader"> Unsure where to start?</h1>
        <p>Hacking and homebrew is a vast topic, and there are so many avenues you are able to go down. The best thing to do is look through your own old devices and go from there! The information page has all you could need to get started learning about how you can hack your very own system.</p>

        <h1 class="textheader"> Is homebrew allowed?</h1>
        <p>The short answer is yes. Homebrewing your consoles and devices is a bit of a legal gray area, especially with newer consoles such as the PlayStation 5, pirates will make the effort to exploit security vulnerabilities in order to play free games. Of course, when a device is no longer in circulation there would be no forseeable harm in the upkeep and extending of the lifespan of your device. Ultimately it is a complex topic that requires some nuance. But I believe that preserving old game consoles is just as important as keeping things like records around, classics will always be classics, after all.</p>

        <h1 class="textheader"> Can you mod the hardware of your console too?</h1>
         <p>There are a range of customisations from custom shells for PSPs and even LED kits for the inside of your console, just to look extra nice! The can be functional in terms of adding bluetooth support, replacing</p>
